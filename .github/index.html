    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      I would like my client to consider the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <p>
        <li><b>Two-steps authentication</b></li>
        Adding a second authentication method such as a third-party program, or
        an open-standard authorization protocol to protect the user.
      </p>

      <p>
        <li><b>Automatic user timeout</b></li>
        For protecting the user's credentials when the user is afk for a longer
        period.
      </p>

      <p>
        <li><b>HTTPS over HTTP</b></li>
        Recommend my client to use a hosting service that grants a SSL
        certificate, thus providing the user with an encrypted connection.
      </p>

      <p>
        <li><b>Web Application Firewall</b></li>
        WAF provides security for common hacking methods, such as XSS and SQL
        injection. It creates a shield between the internet connection and the
        web application, thus protecting their users from security breaches.
      </p>

      <p>
        <li><b>Stay updated</b></li>
        Make sure my client knows the importance of keeping his/her site up to
        date to prevent future threats.
      </p>

      <p>
        <li><b>Automatic backup</b></li>
        To make sure everything is backed up so that the website content won't
        be lost whether it's hacked, or a server failure occurs.
      </p>

      <p>
        <li><b>Internet connectivity</b></li>
        Advice my client against connecting to unknown wi-fi's.
      </p>
    </ul>
